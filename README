PatternPy
=========

A meta-library of reusable generators of python patterns.

This libary is intended to be used to aid the DRY princicple by providing
functions which return generated structured for the common pythonic patterns.

I'm startuing with the registry pattern I seem to keep finding myself using,
but I am more than happy to entertain pull requests for other patterns.
